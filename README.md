# The OpenFlexure Flat-Top Microscope
A number of people have asked whether we could look at larger objects, ranging from mobile phones to 96-well plates, on the OpenFlexure Microscope.  Currently, that's tricky because of our sample stage, which is only big enough to take a standard 75x25mm slide, or a mini (40-50mm diameter) culture dish.  In response, Richard created this project, which combines the Z (focus) axis of the OpenFlexure Microscope with a large, flat top plate that you can sit bigger objects on.  Of course, you now have to move them in X and Y by hand (anyone who wants to add an XY stage to this design is more than welcome), but I hope some people will find this version useful.

Currently there's no illumination - though it should in principle not be that hard to add an illuminator of some sort.
