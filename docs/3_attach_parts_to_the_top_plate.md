# Attach parts to the top plate

{{BOM}}


![The parts required for this step](images\top_plate_parts.jpg)


## Method
### Prepare the standoffs
Insert a [M3x6mm cap head screw]{qty: 4} into each [standoff]{qty: 4} using the large hole that comes out the side of the [standoff].  When you are done, the screw should poke out the end of the part as shown.  There should be four spacers, one for each corner of the plate.  It's probably easiest to use a non-ball-ended hex key to put the screw into place, then use a ball-ended hex key to turn the screw.  The hole may print a little tight - you can either clean it up with a 3mm drill, or simply turn the screw a few times before attaching it to the plate, to ensure any thread that might have formed is stripped away.
