# Assembly instructions
This folder contains the assembly instructions.  They are stored in a series of Markdown files, with some extra metadata using the [buildup] format - this can be compiled by [Git-Building] into a nicely rendered set of instructions with an auto-updated bill of materials.  You can also [view it on GitLab][landing.md] by going to [landing.md].
