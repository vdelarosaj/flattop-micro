# OpenFlexure flat-top microscope

These are the instructions for the "flat top" version of the [OpenFlexure Microscope].  It uses the same focusing mechanism and optics module as v6.1 of the regular microscope, but replaces the XY stage with a large laser cut plate.  This is big enough to allow 96-well plates, mobile phones, petri dishes, or other large objects to be imaged.  Currently it doesn't come with any illumination; I've only used it for a practical class where students were looking at their mobile phone screens.  However, there are holes in the top plate to allow the illuminator from the [OpenFlexure Microscope] to be bolted on, or you can use the reflection version of the microscope optics module.
