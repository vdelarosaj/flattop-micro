# Assemble the focus mechanism

{{BOM}}

![The parts required](images/focus_mechanism_parts.jpg)

## Method
### Assemble the thumbwheel
Push the [M3x25mm hex head screw]{qty:1} into the [thumbwheel]{qty:1}.  Next, thread the [M3 washer] onto the screw.  Place a drop of [light oil] on the screw thread.  You might want to put some kitchen paper or blu roll on your bench to soak up any dribbles of oil.

[M3x25mm hex head screw]: parts/m3x25mm_hex_head_screw.md
[thumbwheel]: parts/thumbwheel.md "{cat:printedpart}"
[M3 washer]: parts/m3_washer.md
[light oil]: parts/light_oil.md "{cat:tool}"

### Insert the nut
Using the [nut insertion tool], push the [M3 brass nut] into the slot in the [focusing assembly].

[M3 brass nut]: parts/m3_brass_nut.md
[focusing assembly]: parts/focusing_assembly.md "{cat:printedpart}"

### Add the thumbwheel
Screw the [thumbwheel] assembly into the [M3 brass nut] in the [focusing assembly].

### Insert the O ring
Next, we will insert the [o-ring] to complete the mechanism.

### Prepare the tool and foot
Thread the [30mm diameter, 2mm thickness Viton O ring][o-ring]{qty:1} through the two holes in the [foot]{qty:1}, and use the [band insertion tool]{qty:1} to stretch the two loops of band as shown in the picture.

[foot]: parts/foot.md "{cat:printedpart}"
[o-ring]: parts/o_ring.md
[band insertion tool]: parts/band_insertion_tool.md "{cat:printedtool}"

### Click the band into place
Line the [foot] up with the hole in the bottom of the [focusing assembly], and push on the [band insertion] tool to click the band into place.  You should feel two clicks as the two ends of the band hook over the actuator column.  It's easier if you use the [nut insertion tool] to hold the mechanism still as you do this.  For more detail, see the instructions for the [openflexure block stage].

### Remove the tool
Gently pull the [band insertion tool] out of the [foot].  The band should pull the foot tight against the [focusing assembly] as shown.

Well done, you have now assembled the focusing mechanism.
